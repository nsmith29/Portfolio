    READ BEFORE USE

    Currently code allows automatic extraction of:
    - Total Energies, Band gap width, Mulliken and Hirshfeld charges, spins, and populations from .log files
    - HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues converted into eV, smeared DOS .dat files, and plot-ready energy and density arrays from
     .pdos files
    - atomic co-ordinates obtained in last geometry optimisation step of calculation, plot-ready displacements of atoms
      in last geometry step from perfect defect free geometry
      and distances of atoms after geometry optimisation from defect site from .xyz files

    Code originally written for being run in a jupyter notebook/lab environment.
    Indication of where code should be inputted into a new jupyter code cell is given by:
# ====================================================================================

    Code variables which need to be individually set to reflect your specific calculations are specified as variable
    types, followed by a comment '#' which identifies what the variable is

    General comments about what the code is doing will be specified as '##'.
