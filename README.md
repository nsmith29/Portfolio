# Portfolio

Hello. Welcome to my coding portfolio. The content of this portfolio consists of code I have developed over the last 3
years in relation to my MPhil research degree. 

In abidance with the UCL Intellectual Property Policy, which I am bound to with my degree, any trace of specifics within
the code related to the materials involved in the research I have conducted have been replaced with generic variable 
names. 

Files within this portfolio have been split by coding language and then by usage and/or implemented coding module/
technique. Each file has been dated - on the files third line - to indicate the rough time period in which the file's 
code was first developed and written. Dates are also given in the titles of these files as well.
